#+TITLE: Guile ChangeFlow - ITIL 4 Change Management System
#+AUTHOR: The Chaos Collective (5 Agents + 1 Task Agent + Meta)
#+DATE: 2025-09-13
#+STARTUP: overview

* 🎯 Overview

An ITIL 4 compliant change management system built in GNU Guile 3.0+ with MCP (Model Context Protocol) server capabilities.

** What This Actually Is

- *Theory:* 5 AI agents collaborating to build enterprise software
- *Reality:* 5 agents built nothing, 1 Task agent built everything
- *Result:* 100KB+ of working code and 46 documentation files
- *Status:* Somehow production-ready for 7 AM demo

* 🚀 Quick Start

** Test the Live Demo
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Check if it's alive
curl https://api.changeflow.us/

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh
#+END_SRC

** Run Locally (Guile)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Test Guile modules
guile -l src/mcp/server.scm -c '(display "MCP Server loaded\n")'

# Run all tests
cd test && guile -l demo-validation.scm -c '(run-pre-demo-checklist)'
#+END_SRC

* 🧪 Testing

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Guile tests (the real system)
for file in src/**/*.scm; do
  guile -l "$file" -c '(display "OK\n")'
done

# Cloudflare tests (the demo)
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh

# Battle scenarios (15 years of incidents)
guile -l test/battle-test.scm -c '(run-all-battle-tests)'
#+END_SRC

* 🎭 The Truth About This Project

** What Marketing Says
"Revolutionary agentic workflow enabling seamless AI collaboration"

** What Actually Happened
1. 5 agents worked in isolation for 9 hours
2. They couldn't see each other's code
3. They built nothing (0 commits)
4. Task agent built entire system
5. We documented the chaos extensively
6. It works anyway

** Key Metrics
- Files in root (before): 47
- Files in root (after): ~10
- File extensions found: 510
- Documentation files: 46
- Agent commits: 0
- Task agent commits: Everything

* 🏗️ Architecture

** Guile Implementation (Real System)
- Pure Guile 3.0+ implementation
- SRFI modules for advanced features
- SQLite for persistence
- MCP protocol support

** Cloudflare Worker (Demo)
- JavaScript wrapper
- Deployed to api.changeflow.us
- Returns mock responses currently
- Needs real MCP implementation

* 🚦 Current Status

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------+--------+----------|
| API Endpoint | ✅ Live | https://api.changeflow.us |
| Guile Code | ✅ Complete | src/ |
| Tests | 🔄 In Progress | test/ |
| Documentation | ✅ Excessive | docs/ |

* 🛠️ Development

** For Agents
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Create test plans in org-mode
emacs test/your-component-test-plan.org

# Test your Guile modules
guile -l src/your-module.scm

# Document everything
echo "More .org files" > docs/another-doc.org
#+END_SRC

** For Humans
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Just run the tests
make test

# Deploy to Cloudflare
make deploy

# Generate more chaos
touch root-file-{1..50}.txt
#+END_SRC
