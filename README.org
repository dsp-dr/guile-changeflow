#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*v1.1.0: The Great Agent Discovery* - 5 AI agents wrote 7,217 lines of code while stuck on permission prompts for 3+ hours. This is their story.
#+END_QUOTE

* 🚀 Overview

An ITIL 4 compliant change management system built with GNU Guile 3.0+ and deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Features MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration.

* 🎯 Quick Start

** Test Production API
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl https://api.changeflow.us/
#+END_SRC

** Run Local MCP Server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Auto-starts with direnv
cd guile-changeflow
# Server runs on port 8427

# Test MCP protocol
curl -X POST http://localhost:8427/ \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
#+END_SRC

* 📊 Architecture

- *Core Models*: ITIL-compliant change requests with full CRUD
- *State Machine*: 9-state workflow with validated transitions
- *Risk Engine*: Automated assessment with freeze periods
- *MCP Server*: 8 ITIL tools via JSON-RPC 2.0
- *Executive Dashboard*: Real-time monitoring and metrics
- *Database*: SQLite with audit trails

* 🤖 The Agent Story

At 1:30 AM on 2025-09-14, we discovered that 5 specialized AI agents had been working in parallel:

| Agent  | Contribution | Lines | Focus Area                       |
|--------+--------------+-------+----------------------------------|
| gcf-a1 | Core Models  | 2,451 | Database, CRUD, State Machine    |
| gcf-a2 | MCP Server   | 1,337 | Alternative Worker Implementation |
| gcf-a3 | Dashboard    | 1,282 | Executive UI, Risk Visualization |
| gcf-a4 | Workflows    | 1,074 | State Transitions, Orchestration |
| gcf-a5 | Testing      | 1,073 | Integration Tests, Documentation |
|--------+--------------+-------+----------------------------------|
| *Total* | *All Work*   | *9,073* | *48 files across project*        |

* 🛠️ Technologies

- *Backend*: GNU Guile 3.0+ (Scheme/Lisp)
- *Deployment*: Cloudflare Workers (Serverless)
- *Protocol*: MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- *Database*: SQLite with WAL mode
- *CI/CD*: GitHub Actions
