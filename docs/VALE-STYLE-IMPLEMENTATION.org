#+TITLE: Vale Style Checking Implementation Report
#+AUTHOR: Documentation Team
#+DATE: [2025-09-28 Sat]

* Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive style checking infrastructure for the ChangeFlow project.

* Completed Tasks

** 1. Makefile Integration
Added new make targets for style checking:
- =gmake lint-vale= - Run Vale style checker
- =gmake lint-spelling= - Check spelling with aspell
- =gmake lint-style= - Combined Vale and spelling check
- =gmake lint-docs-style= - Alias for Vale
- =gmake lint-org-editorial= - Alias for Vale

** 2. CI/CD Workflow
Created =.github/workflows/style-check.yml= with:
- Vale style checking (non-blocking warnings)
- Spelling check with aspell
- Org-mode structure validation
- All checks are informational only - won't block PRs

** 3. Vale Configuration
Enhanced Vale setup with:
- Custom vocabulary in =.vale/styles/config/vocabularies/ChangeFlow/=
  - =accept.txt= - Technical terms whitelist (150+ terms)
  - =reject.txt= - Common misspellings to flag
- Custom capitalization rules
- Disabled conflicting Vale.Terms rule

** 4. Documentation Migration
- Converted all 36 markdown files to org-mode
- Removed original markdown files
- All documentation now consistently uses org-mode

* Current Status

** Vale Issues Remaining
| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------+-------+----------|
| Errors | ~5 | Low (mostly in vocabulary) |
| Warnings | ~50 | Medium (wordiness, passive voice) |
| Suggestions | ~200 | Low (E-Prime style) |

** Files Checked
- All files in =docs/= directory
- Root org files (README.org, CHANGE-REQUEST-MCP-DEPLOYMENT.org)
- Total: 142 org files

* CI/CD Features

** Workflow Triggers
- Pull requests that modify org files
- Push to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

** Non-Blocking Design
- All style checks use =continue-on-error: true=
- Generates reports but doesn't fail builds
- Provides informational feedback to developers

* Usage Instructions

** Local Development
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Run all style checks
gmake lint-style

# Run just Vale
gmake lint-vale

# Check spelling only
gmake lint-spelling

# Full lint including org structure
gmake lint-org lint-style
#+END_SRC

** CI Integration
Style checks run automatically on:
- Every PR that modifies documentation
- Pushes to main branch
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions

** Reviewing Results
1. Check GitHub Actions summary for style reports
2. Download spelling report artifact if needed
3. Review Vale warnings in PR comments (if enabled)

* Next Steps

** Immediate
- [X] Makefile tasks created
- [X] CI workflow implemented
- [X] Vale configuration complete
- [ ] Fix remaining high-priority Vale warnings

** Future Improvements
- [ ] Add custom Vale rules for project-specific style
- [ ] Create aspell personal dictionary for technical terms
- [ ] Add Vale GitHub PR comments integration
- [ ] Create dashboard for style metrics
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for style checking

* Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Automated style checking improves documentation consistency
2. **Non-Blocking**: Developers get feedback without blocking their work
3. **Comprehensive**: Covers style, spelling, and structure
4. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust rules and vocabulary
5. **CI/CD Integrated**: Automatic checks on every change
