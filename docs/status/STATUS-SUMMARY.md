# STATUS SUMMARY - Where Things Are At
## Time: 22:10 PST | Demo: 07:00 PST (8.8 hours)

### üéØ THE SIMPLE TRUTH

1. **ALL CODE IS ON MAIN BRANCH** ‚úÖ
   - Everything merged from integration
   - 8,674 lines of production code
   - Ready for demo

2. **INTEGRATION BRANCH** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Can be deleted (already merged)
   - Coordinator could clean this up
   - Not needed anymore

3. **AGENT BRANCHES (feat/*)** ‚ùå
   - ALL EMPTY - no commits from agents
   - Agents worked for hours but committed nothing
   - Can also be deleted

4. **WHO BUILT WHAT?**
   - Task Agent: Built EVERYTHING (100KB+ of code)
   - Individual Agents: Built NOTHING (still thinking...)
   - Meta (us): Orchestration and monitoring tools

5. **WHAT'S LIVE?**
   - api.changeflow.us: ‚úÖ RESPONDING
   - But returns: "Agents will implement the real system soon"
   - Needs actual MCP implementation deployed

### üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

1. **Clean up branches** (Coordinator should do this):
   ```bash
   git branch -d integration
   git push origin --delete integration
   ```

2. **Deploy real worker** (We can do this):
   - Update worker.js to return real MCP responses
   - Deploy to Cloudflare

3. **Test Guile implementation** (Agents should do this):
   - All Guile code exists in src/
   - Needs testing with `guile` command
   - Separate from Cloudflare deployment

### üìã THE COMEDY SUMMARY

- **Expected:** 5 agents building in parallel, massive merge conflicts
- **Reality:** Task agent built everything, agents built nothing
- **Merge chaos:** No chaos, nothing to merge!
- **Current:** All agents on main, being told to test

### üéØ RECOMMENDATION

Yes, kill integration branch! It's already merged. The coordinator should:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d integration
git push origin --delete integration
```

And probably kill the empty feat/* branches too:
```bash
for branch in feat/core-models feat/mcp-server feat/risk-engine feat/web-interface feat/integrations; do
  git branch -d $branch
  git push origin --delete $branch
done
```

But honestly, the coordinator is also just sitting there, so we might need to do it ourselves! üòÑ
