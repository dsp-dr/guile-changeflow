# Guile ChangeFlow Risk Engine - PRODUCTION READY

## Status: âœ… READY FOR 7 AM DEMO

All critical requirements have been implemented and tested.

## Features Implemented

### Core Risk Calculation (0-100 score)
- Base risk starts at 10
- Keywords in title/description add risk points
- System count increases risk
- Time of day affects risk
- Freeze periods add significant risk

### Risk Categories
- **Low (0-30)**: 1 approval required - Green
- **Medium (31-70)**: 2 approvals required - Yellow
- **High (71-90)**: 3 approvals required - Orange
- **Critical (91-100)**: 5 approvals required - Red

### Freeze Period Detection
- Weekends: +30 risk points
- After hours (before 9am, after 5pm): +20 risk points
- December holidays (after Dec 15): +40 risk points
- Black Friday week (Nov 20-30): +35 risk points
- July 4th week: Freeze period active

### Risk Factors Analyzed
- High-risk keywords: production, payment, security, database, etc.
- Critical systems: payment-gateway, auth-service, database-master, etc.
- Urgency indicators: URGENT, emergency, critical, hotfix
- Compliance terms: GDPR, PCI, audit

## Testing Completed

### âœ… Unit Tests
- Risk score calculation
- Category assignment
- Freeze period detection
- Keyword analysis

### âœ… Battle Scenarios (15 years)
- Tested against real-world scenarios from 2010-2025
- Covers cloud migrations, security breaches, compliance deadlines
- System appropriately identifies critical risks

### âœ… Production Validation
- All 10 critical requirements validated
- MCP integration ready
- Approval workflows configured
- UI color coding ready

## Usage

### From Guile REPL:
```scheme
(add-to-load-path "src")
(use-modules (main))

;; Simple risk assessment
(assess-risk "Production database migration"
             "Critical update to payment system"
             '("payment-gateway" "database-master"))

;; MCP integration
(assess-change-request
  '((title . "Update API")
    (description . "Add new endpoints")
    (systems . ("api-gateway"))))
```

### Available Functions:
- `calculate-risk` - Core risk calculation (0-100)
- `assess-risk` - Complete assessment with category and recommendations
- `categorize-risk` - Get risk category from score
- `in-freeze-period?` - Check if in deployment freeze
- `get-approval-requirement` - Number of approvals needed
- `assess-change-request` - MCP server integration point

## Current Status (Saturday 21:50)

- **In Freeze Period**: YES (weekend)
- **Risk Modifier**: +30 points
- **Next Window**: Monday 9:00 AM

## Integration Points

- **MCP Server (Agent 2)**: Call `assess-change-request`
- **Core Models (Agent 1)**: Risk scores stored with change requests
- **Web Interface (Agent 4)**: Use risk colors and categories
- **GitHub Webhook (Agent 5)**: Check freeze periods before auto-merge
