#+TITLE: Change Request: ITIL Process Simulator Deployment
#+AUTHOR: AYGP-DR (AI Agent)
#+DATE: 2025-09-14
#+CHANGE_ID: CHG-SIM-001
#+STATUS: Draft

* Change Request Summary

** Change ID: CHG-SIM-001
** Type: Normal Change
** Priority: Medium
** Environment: Development → Staging → Production
** Risk Level: Low-Medium
** Requested By: AYGP-DR (Autonomous Agent)
** Sponsor: Development Team Lead
** Implementation Date: 2025-09-15 (Proposed)

* Business Justification

** Problem Statement
The Guile ChangeFlow system lacks comprehensive testing capabilities for ITIL compliance validation. Without proper stress testing, we cannot:
- Identify bottlenecks in change approval workflows
- Validate state machine transitions under load
- Ensure compliance with ITIL 4 best practices
- Train teams on failure scenarios safely

** Proposed Solution
Deploy the ITIL Process Simulator - a chaos engineering tool that:
- Generates 1000+ simulated change requests per hour
- Injects realistic failure scenarios (network, resource, human error)
- Validates ITIL compliance automatically
- Provides comprehensive metrics and reporting

** Business Benefits
- *Risk Reduction*: Identify issues before they impact production
- *Compliance*: Automated ITIL compliance validation
- *Training*: Safe environment for team training
- *Metrics*: Real-time performance and success rate tracking
- *Dogfooding*: Using our own ITIL system to manage changes

* Technical Details

** Components to Deploy
1. Simulator Core Modules (Guile Scheme)
   - change-generator.scm
   - failure-injector.scm
   - state-validator.scm
   - metrics.scm
   - chaos-orchestrator.scm

2. MCP Integration
   - simulator-tools.scm (MCP tool definitions)
   - 5 new MCP tools exposed via JSON-RPC

** Architecture Impact
- No changes to existing production systems
- Runs as separate process on port 8089 (simulator)
- Read-only access to change request database
- Generates synthetic data in isolated namespace

** Dependencies
- Guile 2.2.7+ (already installed)
- SRFI libraries (already available)
- MCP server v2024-11-05 (running)

* Risk Assessment

** Identified Risks

| Risk                        | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                           |
|-----------------------------+------------+--------+--------------------------------------|
| Module loading errors       | Medium     | Low    | Syntax validation completed          |
| Performance impact          | Low        | Low    | Runs on separate port/process        |
| False positive alerts       | Medium     | Low    | Clear "SIMULATION" prefix on changes |
| Resource consumption        | Low        | Medium | Rate limiting built-in               |
| Integration conflicts       | Low        | Low    | Isolated namespace                   |

** Risk Score: 15/100 (Low-Medium)

* Implementation Plan

** Phase 1: Development Environment (Complete)
- [X] Create simulator modules
- [X] Write test harness
- [X] Fix Guile syntax issues
- [X] Create MCP integration

** Phase 2: Staging Deployment (Current)
- [ ] Deploy to staging server
- [ ] Run 24-hour simulation test
- [ ] Validate metrics collection
- [ ] Performance baseline

** Phase 3: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to production workers
- [ ] Configure rate limits
- [ ] Enable monitoring
- [ ] Documentation update

* Testing Strategy

** Unit Testing
- Module loading tests ✓
- Function isolation tests ✓
- State transition validation ✓

** Integration Testing
- [ ] MCP tool invocation
- [ ] Database interaction
- [ ] Metrics aggregation

** Load Testing
- [ ] 100 changes/hour for 24 hours
- [ ] 1000 changes/hour burst test
- [ ] Failure injection under load

** Acceptance Criteria
- Generates valid ITIL-compliant changes
- Correctly identifies compliance violations
- Metrics match manual calculations ±5%
- No impact on production systems

* Rollback Plan

** Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Production system performance degradation >10%
- Memory consumption >2GB
- Error rate >5% in production

** Rollback Procedure
1. Stop simulator process: ~systemctl stop guile-simulator~
2. Remove MCP tool registration
3. Clear simulator data namespace
4. Restore previous configuration
5. Verify production stability

** Rollback Time: <5 minutes

* Communication Plan
