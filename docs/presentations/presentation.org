* The Problem

** Traditional Change Management is Broken

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- 67% of changes are delayed by approval bottlenecks
- Average change approval time: 14.3 days
- 89% of "emergency" changes could have been prevented
- $2.3M average cost of change-related incidents

** The DevOps Conflict

#+begin_quote
"We need to deploy 50 times per day, but change approval takes 2 weeks"
#+end_quote

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- DevOps: Speed, automation, continuous delivery
- ITIL: Control, documentation, risk mitigation
- Result: Shadow IT, compliance violations, audit failures

** Current Solutions Fall Short

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| ServiceNow | Enterprise features | Complex, expensive |
| Jenkins | DevOps native | No governance |
| Manual process | Full control | Slow, error-prone |
| Skip change mgmt | Fast deployment | Compliance risk |

* The Solution

** ITIL 4: From Control to Enablement

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- 2019 paradigm shift: "Change Management" → "Change Enablement"
- Risk-based decision making
- Integration with modern DevOps practices
- Value stream focus

** AI Agents Need Tools

#+begin_quote
"Claude can write code, but it can't deploy safely to production"
#+end_quote

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
- AI agents as first-class users
- Natural language change requests
- Intelligent risk assessment

** Why Functional Programming?

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- *Immutable state*: Perfect audit trails
- *Pure functions*: Predictable risk calculations
- *Pattern matching*: Complex approval routing
- *Continuations*: Natural workflow modeling
- *Homoiconicity*: DSLs for business rules

* Guile ChangeFlow

** Architecture Overview

#+end_src

** Core Features

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- *Automated Risk Assessment*: AI-powered analysis
- *Intelligent Routing*: Role-based approval paths
- *Calendar Integration*: Freeze period awareness
- *Audit Compliance*: Immutable change history
- *Developer Experience*: Self-service via Claude

** Risk Assessment Algorithm

#+begin_src scheme :exports code
(define (calculate-risk change)
  (let ((score 0))
    (when (production-system? change)
      (set! score (+ score 40)))
    (when (security-related? change)
      (set! score (+ score 30)))
    (when (data-modification? change)
      (set! score (+ score 25)))
    (+ score (* (length (affected-systems change)) 5))))
#+end_src

** Change Types & Automation

| Risk Score | Type | Approval | SLA |
|------------|------|----------|-----|
| < 30 | Standard | Automatic | Instant |
| 30-70 | Normal | Required | 2-4 hours |
| > 70 | Emergency | Expedited | 30 minutes |

* Competitive Advantage

** Unique Positioning

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- *First*: Native AI agent integration (MCP)
- *Only*: Functional programming approach
- *Modern*: ITIL 4 enablement (not control)
- *Open*: No vendor lock-in

** Market Opportunity

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- ITSM market: $8.5B in 2024
- Growing 12% annually
- Platform engineering: 80% adoption by 2026
- AI/ML integration: $7.4B by 2032

** Why Now?

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- Claude Code launched (AI agents mainstream)
- ITIL 4 adoption accelerating
- Platform engineering momentum
- DevOps maturity plateau

** User Experience

#+begin_example
User: "Deploy the new payment gateway update"

Claude: I'll create a change request for you.
