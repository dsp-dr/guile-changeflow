Hey jwalsh,

ChangeFlow MCP v1.3.1 SSE deployment is complete! 🎉

Need you to add the GitHub OAuth Client ID to Cloudflare Workers environment:

Key: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
Value: Ov23lir2JJgJffb51RPs

This is public (not secret) but the deployment keeps blowing away dashboard env vars.

Added fallback in code but environment variable is preferred.

Endpoints working:
✅ https://mcp.changeflow.us/v1/sse (SSE for Claude.ai)
✅ https://mcp.changeflow.us/favicon.ico
❌ https://mcp.changeflow.us/authorize (needs env var)

Once added, full OAuth → SSE flow will work for integration tomorrow.

Thanks!
