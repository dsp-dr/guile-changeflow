#+TITLE: OAuth Implementation Planning - Day Summary
#+DATE: 2025-09-14
#+AUTHOR: dsp-dr

* Today's Accomplishments

** ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Fixed
- Deployment working to correct worker (guile-changeflow-prod)
- Post-deployment checks passing
- Version tracking implemented
- Cleaned up duplicate workers

** ✅ Documentation Created
- Complete architecture overview with diagrams
- CI/CD sequence diagrams
- MCP integration flow documentation
- Claude.ai Custom Connector setup guide

** ✅ Demo Ready
- Production API fully operational
- All 4 ITIL tools working
- Risk scoring functioning correctly
- Test script verifying all endpoints

** ✅ Repository Organized
- Clear separation: JS (production) vs Guile (research)
- Clean directory structure
- Division of work documented for parallel development

* Next Steps: OAuth Implementation

** Why OAuth Now?
- Claude.ai Custom Connectors support Remote MCP servers
- Cloudflare provides OAuth patterns for Workers
- Enables user-scoped access and permissions
- Links changes to real GitHub users

** Implementation Strategy
Following Cloudflare's guide:
1. Start with public server (✅ DONE)
2. Add OAuth wrapper
3. Implement GitHub OAuth flow
4. Add user context to tools

** Key Resources
- Issue #21: https://github.com/dsp-dr/guile-changeflow/issues/21
- Cloudflare Guide: https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/
- Anthropic Docs: https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11503834

* Production URLs

| Endpoint | Status | Purpose |
|----------+--------+---------|
| https://api.changeflow.us/health | ✅ Working | Health check |
| https://api.changeflow.us/mcp | ✅ Working | Protocol info |
| https://api.changeflow.us/mcp/tools | ✅ Working | Tool list |
| https://api.changeflow.us/mcp/tools/invoke | ✅ Working | Tool execution |
| https://api.changeflow.us/authorize | ❌ TODO | OAuth initiation |
| https://api.changeflow.us/callback | ❌ TODO | OAuth callback |
| https://api.changeflow.us/token | ❌ TODO | Token exchange |

* Risk: Production-Only Development

Since we can't run wrangler locally (FreeBSD), we're doing:
- Direct edits to production
- No staging environment tests
- Immediate deployment on push
- Testing with real Claude.ai

This is acceptable because:
- It's a demo/prototype
- No real user data
- Can rollback quickly
- Learning experience with new tech

* Timeline

- **Today**: Fixed CI/CD, documented everything, created OAuth plan
- **Tomorrow**: Implement OAuth endpoints
- **Monday**: Test with Claude.ai Custom Connectors
- **This Week**: Complete GitHub integration
