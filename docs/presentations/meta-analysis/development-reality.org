* The Experiment

** Hypothesis
5 AI agents can collaboratively build enterprise software

** Reality
- Agent 1-5: Built 0 lines of code in 5.5 hours
- Task Agent: Built entire system in 2.5 hours
- Outcome: Working production system despite agent failure

* What Actually Happened

** Multi-Agent Results
- Extensive documentation
- Philosophical discussions about ITIL
- 47 files dumped in root directory
- Zero functional code

** Task Agent Results
- 22 Guile modules
- MCP protocol implementation
- Cloudflare Worker deployment
- Comprehensive testing suite

* Technical Achievements

** Despite the Chaos
- 100% Guile 3 module compatibility
- Full MCP protocol implementation
- ITIL 4 compliant workflows
- Production deployment at api.changeflow.us

** Lesson Learned
Simple, direct tools remain superior to complex coordination workflows
