#+STARTUP: overview

* Executive Summary

This research document provides background that should have informed our Guile ChangeFlow design, covering competing methodologies, historical context, agent tool patterns, and essential reading. It synthesizes insights from L7 engineering and CTO perspectives on modern change management approaches.

* Competing Change Management Methodologies

** DevOps Approaches

*** GitOps
- *Philosophy*: Git as single source of truth for declarative infrastructure
- *Change Process*: Pull-based deployments from Git repositories
- *Key Benefits*: Version control, audit trail, rollback capability
- *vs ITIL*: More automated, less human approval gates

*** Progressive Delivery
- *Philosophy*: Feature flags for zero-risk deployment
- *Change Process*: Gradual rollouts with immediate rollback
- *Key Benefits*: A/B testing, blue/green deployments
- *vs ITIL*: Continuous rather than discrete changes

** SRE Practices

*** Error Budgets
- *Philosophy*: Quantified acceptable unreliability from SLOs
- *Change Process*: Data-driven release decisions
- *Implementation*: If budget available → deploy; if exhausted → freeze
- *Example*: 99.9% SLO = 0.1% error budget monthly

*** SLOs and SLIs
- *Purpose*: Measurable reliability targets
- *Change Control*: Common incentive for dev and ops
- *Best Practice*: Realistic targets based on user expectations

** Agile Frameworks

*** SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
- *Scale*: Enterprise-level transformation
- *Change Process*: Sprint-based with PI planning
- *Alignment*: Regular synchronization across portfolios
- *vs ITIL*: More iterative, less documentation-heavy

*** Lean Change Management
- *Approach*: MVP-based with continuous improvement
- *Focus*: Experimentation and learning
- *Integration*: Works alongside other methodologies

** Human-Centered Models

*** ADKAR
- *Components*: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement
- *Focus*: Individual change readiness
- *Approach*: Bottom-up, people-first
- *Use Case*: Organizational transformation

*** Kotter's 8-Step Process
1. Create urgency
2. Build coalition
3. Form vision
4. Communicate vision
5. Empower action
6. Create wins
7. Consolidate gains
8. Anchor changes
- *Limitation*: Linear, less adaptable to rapid change

** Modern Platform Engineering

*** Platform as Product
- *2024 Stats*: 83% adoption in some capacity
- *Gartner*: 80% will have platform teams by 2026
- *Focus*: Developer experience (DX) as primary metric

*** Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
- *Purpose*: Self-service infrastructure interface
- *Components*: Software catalog, golden paths, scorecards
- *Impact*: 69% of developers lose 8+ hours weekly to inefficiencies

*** Policy as Code
- *Definition*: Machine-readable policy management
- *Trends*: AI/ML for automated updates
- *Integration*: CI/CD pipeline enforcement

* Historical Context

** Evolution of Change Management

*** Origins: UK Government & Peter Brooks (1986-1989)

ITIL was created by the UK Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), later absorbed into the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). The primary architect was *Peter Brooks*, who served as the project leader for what would become ITIL v1.

*Historical Context:*
- Margaret Thatcher's government was modernizing public services
- IT costs were spiraling out of control across government departments
- No standardized approach to IT service delivery
- Private sector was outperforming government IT significantly

*Original Motivation:*
Brooks and his team at CCTA were tasked with answering: "How can we make government IT services as efficient and cost-effective as the best private sector practices?"

*Core Philosophy (1980s):*
- Borrowed heavily from manufacturing quality control (ISO 9000)
- Process-driven approach (influenced by Total Quality Management)
- Documentation as the foundation of consistency
- Centralized control to prevent "cowboy" implementations

*Key Founding Principles:*
1. *Service Focus*: IT as a service provider, not just technology
2. *Process Orientation*: Repeatable, documented procedures
3. *Best Practice*: Learn from others rather than reinventing
4. *Vendor Neutrality*: Framework independent of technology choices

*** 1980s: ITIL v1
- Born from UK government's need for IT service management under Peter Brooks
- Focus on centralized control and documentation
- Change Advisory Board (CAB) as gatekeepers
- Heavy influence from manufacturing quality control (TQM, ISO 9000)
- 40+ books covering every aspect of IT operations

*** 1990s-2000s: ITIL v2 & v3 Evolution

*ITIL v2 (2000-2007):*
- Led by OGC under Tony Gamblen and Jenny Dugmore
- Consolidated 40+ books into 7 core volumes
- Introduction of Service Support and Service Delivery
- Focus on process maturity models (CMMI influence)
- Heavy emphasis on documentation and control

*Key v2 Innovations:*
- Incident Management as separate from Problem Management
- Configuration Management Database (CMDB) concept
- Service Level Management formalization
- Financial Management for IT Services

*ITIL v3 (2007-2011):*
- Major paradigm shift under Sharon Taylor (Chief Architect)
- Service Lifecycle model: Strategy → Design → Transition → Operation → CSI
- Move from processes to lifecycle thinking
- Integration with business strategy
- 5 core books instead of 7

*v3 Change Management Philosophy:*
- Risk and impact assessment introduction
- Authorization levels (CAB, ECAB, Local)
- Change types: Standard, Normal, Emergency
- Post-implementation review requirements

*** 2010s: DevOps Revolution
- "Move fast and break things" culture
- Continuous delivery emergence
- Conflict with traditional ITSM

*** 2019: ITIL 4 - The "Enablement" Revolution

*Leadership & Vision:*
- Led by AXELOS (joint venture between UK government and Capita)
- Chief Architect: Lou Hunnebeck
- Influenced by Patrick Bolger (DevOps integration)
- Response to DevOps criticism and cloud transformation

*Fundamental Philosophy Shift:*
- From "Change Management" → "Change Enablement"
- From "Control" → "Facilitate"
- From "Gates" → "Guidelines"
- From "Prevention" → "Acceleration"

*Service Value System (SVS):*
1. *Guiding Principles*: Focus on value, start where you are, progress iteratively
2. *Governance*: Directing and controlling rather than blocking
3. *Service Value Chain*: Plan, Improve, Engage, Design, Obtain, Deliver
4. *Practices*: 34 practices (not processes) across 3 categories
5. *Continual Improvement*: Built into every activity

*Change Enablement in ITIL 4:*
- Risk-based decision making (automated where possible)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Embrace of "fail fast, learn quickly"
- Pre-authorized change patterns
- Post-implementation optimization focus

*** 2020s: AI/ML Integration
- Predictive risk analysis
- Automated approval routing
- Natural language processing for requests

** Key Paradigm Shifts

1. *Control → Enablement*: From gatekeeping to facilitating
2. *Manual → Automated*: From human approvals to policy engines
3. *Reactive → Predictive*: From incident response to prevention
4. *Discrete → Continuous*: From big bang to incremental
5. *Siloed → Integrated*: From separate teams to collaborative
