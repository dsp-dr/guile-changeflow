#+TITLE: ChangeFlow MCP Status Report
#+DATE: 2025-09-14
#+AUTHOR: ChangeFlow Team

* Executive Summary

Successfully deployed v1.3.2 with OAuth redirect flow for Claude.ai integration. The system now automatically redirects unauthenticated requests to GitHub OAuth, maintaining session state through cookies for subsequent SSE connections.

* Deployment Status

** Production (mcp.changeflow.us)
- Version: v1.3.2
- Status: ✅ Operational
- OAuth Flow: ✅ Working (302 redirect to GitHub)
- SSE Endpoint: ✅ Ready
- Deployment Time: 2025-09-14 22:15 UTC

** Key Changes Deployed
1. OAuth redirect flow for /v1/sse endpoint
2. Session cookie management (mcp_session)
3. Automatic redirect for unauthenticated requests
4. Support for both cookie and Bearer token auth

* Technical Implementation

** OAuth Flow Sequence
#+BEGIN_SRC
1. Claude.ai → GET /v1/sse (no auth)
2. Server → 302 Redirect to GitHub OAuth
3. User → Authorizes on GitHub
4. GitHub → Redirect to /callback with code
5. Server → Exchange code for token
6. Server → Set session cookie
7. Server → Return success page
8. Claude.ai → GET /v1/sse (with cookie)
9. Server → SSE stream established
#+END_SRC

** Authentication Methods
- Session cookies (mcp_session) - Primary for Claude.ai
- Bearer tokens - Backward compatibility
- No auth required after OAuth completion

* Environment Variables

** Configured in wrangler.toml
- ENVIRONMENT = "production"
- LOG_LEVEL = "info"
- GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = "Ov23lir2JJgJffb51RPs"

** Required in Cloudflare Dashboard
- GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (as Secret)

* Testing Results

** OAuth Redirect Test
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -i https://mcp.changeflow.us/v1/sse
# Result: HTTP/2 302
# Location: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=...
#+END_SRC

** Health Check
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl https://mcp.changeflow.us/health
# Status: healthy
# Version: 1.3.2
# Capabilities: [mcp, change_management, risk_assessment, oauth]
#+END_SRC

* Known Issues & Resolutions

** Issue: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID Deletion on Deploy
- Problem: Environment variable deleted during deployment
- Solution: Added to wrangler.toml [vars] section
- Status: ✅ Resolved

** Issue: Claude.ai 401 Errors
- Problem: Claude.ai doesn't send Bearer tokens after OAuth
- Solution: Implemented session cookie authentication
- Status: ✅ Resolved

** Issue: Missing OAuth Redirect
- Problem: /v1/sse returning 401 instead of redirecting
- Solution: Added redirect logic for unauthenticated requests
- Status: ✅ Resolved

* Next Steps

1. Monitor Claude.ai connection success rate
2. Implement token refresh mechanism if needed
3. Add metrics for OAuth flow completion
4. Consider implementing state persistence in KV store

* Deployment Commands

** Manual Production Deploy
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gh workflow run deploy-cloudflare.yml \
  --repo dsp-dr/guile-changeflow \
  -f environment=production
#+END_SRC

** Check Deployment Status
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gh run list --repo dsp-dr/guile-changeflow --limit 5
#+END_SRC

* Lessons Learned

1. Claude.ai uses session-based auth, not Bearer tokens post-OAuth
2. Cloudflare Workers supports cookies with SameSite=None for cross-origin
3. GitHub Actions defaults to staging without explicit environment
4. wrangler.toml [vars] persists across deployments vs dashboard values
