Task: Document AI agent context preservation strategy

Context:
- User requested documentation on preserving AI agent decisions
- Referenced YouTube video and HN discussions on agentic development
- Need to track why agents make specific implementation choices

Decisions:
- Used org-mode format for consistency with project standards
- Implemented simple post-commit hook as reminder mechanism
- Focused on git notes as parallel metadata system
- Included practical examples and industry references

Rationale:
- Git notes don't pollute commit history but travel with commits
- Post-commit hook provides gentle reminder without being intrusive
- Documentation covers both theory and practice
- Checklist format makes implementation actionable

Trade-offs:
- Simple reminder over automated extraction (start simple)
- Manual notes over AI parsing (human judgment valuable)
- Local hook over global config (project-specific needs)
