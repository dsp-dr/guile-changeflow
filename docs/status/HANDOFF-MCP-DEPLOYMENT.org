* Current Status: ✅ DEPLOYMENT WORKING

** Production URLs
- Worker URL: https://gcf-mcp-server.jasonwalsh.workers.dev
- Custom Domain: https://api.changeflow.us (needs DNS update to point to worker)

** What's Deployed
- MCP server with 4 ITIL tools (create_change_request, get_change_request, list_change_requests, assess_risk)
- Located in: infra/cloudflare/worker.js
- Source: mcp-server/changeflow-mcp.js
- Version tracking: .version file with commit SHA

** CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Deployment workflow working
- ✅ Post-deployment checks updated to verify both URLs
- ⚠️ Scheme linting hanging (needs investigation)

* Division of Work

** Our Part (COMPLETE)
- [X] Fixed deployment path from experiments/ to infra/cloudflare/
- [X] Cleaned up infra directory (only worker.js and wrangler.toml)
- [X] Fixed wrangler.toml configuration
- [X] Added version tracking
- [X] Updated post-deployment checks
- [X] Created git hooks for agent documentation

** Coordinator & Builder Agent Tasks
- [ ] Get MCP Inspector working with local server (port 8427)
- [ ] Validate all 8 ITIL tools through Inspector
- [ ] Improve mock data generation
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Document the MCP protocol implementation

** Next Steps for DNS
- Need to update api.changeflow.us to point to gcf-mcp-server.jasonwalsh.workers.dev
- Or configure custom domain in Cloudflare dashboard
