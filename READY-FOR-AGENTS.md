# Ready for 12-Hour Agent Development Session

## âœ… Setup Complete

### Worktrees Created and Synced
- `gcf-core-models` â†’ feat/core-models
- `gcf-mcp-server` â†’ feat/mcp-server
- `gcf-risk-engine` â†’ feat/risk-engine
- `gcf-web-interface` â†’ feat/web-interface
- `gcf-integrations` â†’ feat/integrations

### Instructions Deployed
Each worktree has `instructions/<role>.org` with:
- Detailed specifications
- Code templates
- Integration points
- Testing guidelines
- Timeline expectations

### Infrastructure Ready
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline working (deployed to api.changeflow.us)
- âœ… Branch sync monitoring in place
- âœ… Skeleton MCP server deployed (agents will replace)
- âœ… Documentation extensive (6,500+ lines)
- âœ… Integration test plan defined

## What to Tell Each Agent

Simple instruction for all agents:
```
Look in the instructions/ directory for your specific tasks.
You have 5 hours to build your component, then we integrate.
```

## Expected Chaos Points ðŸŽ­

1. **No actual Guile/Scheme code exists yet** - agents start from zero
2. **Integration dependencies** - Agent 2 needs Agent 1's models
3. **Port conflicts** - 8080 (web), 8081 (MCP), 8082 (webhooks)
4. **Module paths** - Guile's module system is... unique
5. **Merge conflicts** - when bringing branches together

## Timeline

```
Hour 0-1:  Setup and initial scaffolding
Hour 2-3:  Core implementation
Hour 4-5:  Component testing
Hour 6:    Integration begins (chaos expected)
Hour 7-8:  Bug fixes and coordination
Hour 9-10: Demo preparation
Hour 11:   Final polish
Hour 12:   DEMO TIME
```

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch all agents
tmux ls

# Check branch status
git worktree list

# Monitor deployments
gh run list --workflow=deploy-cloudflare.yml

# Test endpoints
curl https://api.changeflow.us/health
```

## Success Criteria

Minimal viable demo showing:
1. Create change via MCP tool
2. Risk score calculated
3. Change appears in dashboard
4. One state transition works

## The Beautiful Part

- Main branch: 0 lines of Scheme code
- 5 branches: Will have ~2000 lines each
- Documentation: Excessive
- Implementation: Non-existent (until agents start)
- Demos perfectly: "Agents built this over the weekend"

Ready to unleash the agents! ðŸš€
