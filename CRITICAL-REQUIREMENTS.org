* THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING

We're building a PRODUCTION-GRADE system, not a toy. Every component must be:
- Reliable
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Observable
- Recoverable
- Secure
- Tested
- Documented

NO SHORTCUTS. NO EXCUSES. BUILD IT RIGHT.

The demo tomorrow will showcase a REAL enterprise change management system that could be deployed to production. This is our chance to prove multi-agent development can build serious software.

AGENTS: READ THIS AND IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING. The clock is ticking.
