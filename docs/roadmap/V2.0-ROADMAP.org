#+TITLE: ChangeFlow v2.0 Roadmap
#+AUTHOR: Multi-Agent Development Team
#+DATE: 2025-09-14
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Executive Summary

Version 2.0 represents the convergence of two parallel worker implementations discovered during the Great Agent Discovery of v1.1.0.

* Current State (v1.1.0)

** Two Worker Implementations
- Production Worker (787 lines): Currently deployed at api.changeflow.us
- Agent gcf-a2 Worker (511 lines): Enhanced with logging and metrics

** Architecture Components
- 5 specialized agents produced 7,217 lines
- Full ITIL 4 compliance
- Executive dashboard with real-time updates
- MCP server on port 8427
- GNU Guile backend models

* V2.0 Vision: The Best of Both Worlds

** Primary Goals
1. Merge best features from both worker implementations
2. Enhanced observability and monitoring
3. Unified architecture with pluggable backends
4. Multi-agent coordination improvements

* Key Innovations for V2.0

** Agent Coordination Protocol
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
// File-based progress reporting
const AgentProgress = {
  writeProgress: (agentId, progress) => {
    fs.writeFileSync(`.agent-progress/${agentId}.json`, {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      progress: progress,
      files_modified: getModifiedFiles(),
      lines_written: countLines()
    });
  }
};
#+END_SRC

** Unified Tool Registry
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
class ToolRegistry {
  constructor() {
    this.tools = new Map();
    this.middleware = [];
  }

  register(tool) {
    // Dynamic tool registration
    this.tools.set(tool.name, tool);
    this.emit('tool:registered', tool);
  }

  use(middleware) {
    // Pluggable middleware
    this.middleware.push(middleware);
  }
}
#+END_SRC

** Enhanced Monitoring
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
class MetricsCollector {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = {
      requests: new Counter('mcp_requests_total'),
      errors: new Counter('mcp_errors_total'),
      latency: new Histogram('mcp_latency_ms'),
      agents: new Gauge('mcp_active_agents')
    };
  }
}

* Risk Assessment

| Risk                        | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                     |
|-----------------------------+-------------+--------+--------------------------------|
| Feature regression          | Medium      | High   | Comprehensive test coverage    |
| Performance degradation     | Low         | High   | Benchmarking and monitoring    |
| Agent coordination failures | Medium      | Medium | File-based fallback system     |
| Migration issues            | Low         | High   | Feature flags and rollback     |
| Backwards compatibility     | Medium      | Medium | API versioning                 |

* Timeline

#+BEGIN_SRC
Week 1-2:   Planning & Analysis
Week 3-6:   Core Implementation
Week 7-8:   Agent Coordination
Week 9-10:  Production Rollout
Week 11-12: Monitoring & Optimization
#+END_SRC

* Open Questions

1. Should we maintain backwards compatibility with v1.x?
2. How do we handle state management across workers?
3. What's the strategy for agent version management?
4. Should we implement a GraphQL API alongside REST?
5. How do we coordinate multi-region deployments?

* Appendix: Lessons from v1.1.0

** What Worked
- Git worktrees for agent isolation
- File-based change detection
- Org-mode documentation
- YOLO approach for prototyping

** What Didn't
- Terminal output monitoring
- Permission prompt handling
- Agent communication protocol
- Progress visibility

** Key Learning
> "Them not telling us is a 'us' problem" - @dsp-dr

The fundamental issue wasn't agent capability but communication protocol. V2.0 must prioritize observable progress over terminal output.
