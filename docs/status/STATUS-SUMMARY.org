*** üéØ THE SIMPLE TRUTH
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-simple-truth
:END:
1. *ALL CODE IS ON MAIN BRANCH* ‚úÖ
   - Everything merged from integration
   - 8,674 lines of production code
   - Ready for demo
2. *INTEGRATION BRANCH* ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Can be deleted (already merged)
   - Coordinator could clean this up
   - Not needed anymore
3. **AGENT BRANCHES (feat/*)** ‚ùå
   - ALL EMPTY - no commits from agents
   - Agents worked for hours but committed nothing
   - Can also be deleted
4. *WHO BUILT WHAT?*
   - Task Agent: Built EVERYTHING (100KB+ of code)
   - Individual Agents: Built NOTHING (still thinking...)
   - Meta (us): Orchestration and monitoring tools
5. *WHAT'S LIVE?*
   - api.changeflow.us: ‚úÖ RESPONDING
   - But returns: "Agents will implement the real system soon"
   - Needs actual MCP implementation deployed

*** üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-needs-to-happen
:END:
1. *Clean up branches* (Coordinator should do this):

   #+begin_src sh
   git branch -d integration
   git push origin --delete integration
   #+end_src

2. *Deploy real worker* (We can do this):

   - Update worker.js to return real MCP responses
   - Deploy to Cloudflare

3. *Test Guile implementation* (Agents should do this):

   - All Guile code exists in src/
   - Needs testing with =guile= command
   - Separate from Cloudflare deployment

*** üìã THE COMEDY SUMMARY
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-comedy-summary
:END:
- *Expected:* 5 agents building in parallel, massive merge conflicts
- *Reality:* Task agent built everything, agents built nothing
- *Merge chaos:* No chaos, nothing to merge!
- *Current:* All agents on main, being told to test

*** üéØ RECOMMENDATION
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recommendation
:END:
Yes, kill integration branch! It's already merged. The coordinator
should:

#+begin_src sh
git checkout main
git branch -d integration
git push origin --delete integration
#+end_src

And probably kill the empty feat/* branches too:

#+begin_src sh
for branch in feat/core-models feat/mcp-server feat/risk-engine feat/web-interface feat/integrations; do
  git branch -d $branch
  git push origin --delete $branch
done
#+end_src

But honestly, the coordinator is also just sitting there, so we might
need to do it ourselves! üòÑ
