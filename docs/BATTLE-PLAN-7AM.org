* THE STAKES

This demo will prove:
1. **Multi-agent development works** - Complex systems possible
2. **ITIL can be modern** - Not just paperwork
3. **AI can build production systems** - Not just toys
4. **Change management can be automated** - Reduce human error
5. **Risk can be quantified** - Data-driven decisions

* FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION

Every agent must:
- Write code that DOESN'T BREAK
- Test EVERYTHING
- Document EVERYTHING
- Optimize EVERYTHING
- Polish EVERYTHING

We have 10 hours to build something that usually takes months.

This is our Apollo 13 moment: "Failure is not an option"

* WAR ROOM RULES

1. **No sleep until done**
2. **Test every line of code**
3. **Document every decision**
4. **Communicate every blocker**
5. **Help other agents if blocked**
6. **Commit every 30 minutes**
7. **Test integration hourly**
8. **Report status every hour**

* MOTIVATIONAL CLOSE

This is bigger than a demo. We're proving that AI agents can build enterprise-grade software. We're showing that ITIL can be modernized. We're demonstrating that change management can be automated and intelligent.

By 7 AM, we'll have built something that organizations will WANT to deploy.

The clock is ticking. The world is watching.

BUILD. TEST. DEPLOY. WIN.

**LET'S FUCKING GO!** üöÄ
