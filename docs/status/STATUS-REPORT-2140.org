*** Critical Pivot: Permission Apocalypse → Recovery
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: critical-pivot-permission-apocalypse-recovery
:END:
*MAJOR PIVOT EXECUTED:* - *21:20* - Discovered all 5 agents stuck on
permission prompts for HOURS - *21:30* - User intervention: "nuke from
orbit" - killed all sessions - *21:35* - Restarted all agents with
=claude --dangerously-skip-permissions= - *21:40* - All agents now
actively working!

*** Lessons Learned from the Pivot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lessons-learned-from-the-pivot
:END:
1. *Permission Prompt Hell*
   - Without =--dangerously-skip-permissions=, agents cannot work
     autonomously
   - Every tool use triggers a blocking permission dialog
   - Agents sat idle for hours waiting for permission approvals
2. *The CDSP Protocol*
   - Ctrl-D → S → P → Enter (system prompt mode)
   - Inject battle instructions
   - Ctrl-D again to exit and execute
3. *Worktree Verification*
   - Always verify worktrees exist before starting agents
   - Agents need their own isolated branches
   - Integration branch still needed for merging

*** Production System Status
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: production-system-status
:END:
✅ *Already Deployed:* - Cloudflare Worker live at api.changeflow.us -
31KB production worker.js with full MCP protocol - 28KB SQLite schema
with 16 ITIL tables - 31KB battle-test.scm with 15 years of scenarios

⏳ *In Progress (Post-Pivot):* - Agents building their respective
components - Workers Logs integration (Agent 2) - Executive dashboard
(Agent 4) - Integration testing (Agent 5)

*** Timeline to 7 AM Demo
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: timeline-to-7-am-demo
:END:
- *Now (21:40):* 9 hours 20 minutes remaining
- *Agents:* All 6 sessions active with permission bypass
- *Confidence:* MEDIUM (agents working but late start)
- *Risk:* Agents may duplicate existing work

*** Next Steps
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: next-steps
:END:
1. Monitor agent progress every 15 minutes
2. Merge agent branches if they produce new code
3. Run battle tests on integrated system
4. Prepare executive presentation
5. Test api.changeflow.us with real scenarios

*** The Orchestration Comedy Continues
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-orchestration-comedy-continues
:END:
*Act 1:* Agents in isolation (can't see each other's code) *Act 2:*
Permission prompt purgatory (hours of "May I?") *Act 3:* The Great
Restart (nuke and rebuild) *Act 4:* Finally working! (with
--dangerously-skip-permissions)

*** Key Insight
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-insight
:END:
The pivot from permission-blocked agents to autonomous agents with
=--dangerously-skip-permissions= was critical. Without this flag,
multi-agent systems cannot function autonomously. This should be the
DEFAULT for any agent experiment.
