# README Banner Generation Prompt

## Objective
Create a professional banner image for the Guile ChangeFlow project README that represents ITIL 4 change management integrated with AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- Modern, clean, and professional
- Technology-focused with enterprise reliability feel
- Color palette: Deep blues (#0F172A, #1E293B), accent blue (#3B82F6), success green (#10B981)
- Dimensions: 1200x300px (optimal for GitHub README)

### Key Elements to Include

1. **Project Name**: "Guile ChangeFlow" prominently displayed
2. **Tagline**: "ITIL 4 Change Management for AI"
3. **Visual Metaphors**:
   - Flowing data streams or connections (representing change flow)
   - Network nodes or interconnected systems
   - Shield or security elements (representing governance and safety)
   - AI/automation symbols subtly integrated

4. **Technology Indicators**:
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) reference
   - Cloud/serverless architecture hints
   - API connectivity visualization

### Text Hierarchy
- Primary: Project name (largest)
- Secondary: Tagline
- Tertiary (optional): Key features like "OAuth-enabled", "Claude.ai Ready", "Enterprise-grade"

### Style Guidelines
- Use gradients sparingly for depth
- Geometric shapes preferred over organic forms
- Subtle grid or pattern overlay acceptable
- Should work well in both light and dark GitHub themes

## Example Prompt for AI Image Generator

"Create a modern technology banner (1200x300px) for 'Guile ChangeFlow' - an ITIL 4 change management system for AI. Use a dark blue (#0F172A) background with flowing data streams in bright blue (#3B82F6). Include the text 'Guile ChangeFlow' in bold, modern font with the tagline 'ITIL 4 Change Management for AI' below. Add subtle network node visualizations and a shield element suggesting security and governance. Professional, clean, enterprise software aesthetic with hints of AI/automation. No people or faces."

## Alternative Concepts

1. **Flow Chart Style**: Abstract representation of change approval workflow
2. **Circuit Board**: Technology infrastructure with highlighted pathways
3. **Dashboard View**: Minimalist monitoring interface visualization
4. **Abstract Waves**: Data flow and transformation representation

## File Requirements
- Format: PNG or SVG
- Resolution: 2x for retina displays (2400x600px actual)
- File size: Under 1MB for fast loading
- Transparency: No (use solid background)

## Placement
```markdown
