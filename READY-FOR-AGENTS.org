#+TITLE: Ready for 12-Hour Agent Development Session
#+DATE: 2025-09-13
#+STARTUP: overview

* Setup Complete

** Worktrees Created and Synced
| Worktree | Branch | Focus |
|----------+--------+-------|
| gcf-core-models | feat/core-models | Data models & state machine |
| gcf-mcp-server | feat/mcp-server | MCP protocol for Claude |
| gcf-risk-engine | feat/risk-engine | Risk calculation |
| gcf-web-interface | feat/web-interface | Dashboard & API |
| gcf-integrations | feat/integrations | GitHub webhooks |

** Instructions Deployed
Each worktree has =instructions/<role>.org= with:
- Detailed specifications
- Code templates
- Integration points
- Testing guidelines
- Timeline expectations

** Infrastructure Ready
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline working (deployed to api.changeflow.us)
- âœ… Branch sync monitoring in place
- âœ… Skeleton MCP server deployed (agents will replace)
- âœ… Documentation extensive (6,500+ lines)
- âœ… Integration test plan defined

* What to Tell Each Agent

#+begin_example
Look in the instructions/ directory for your specific tasks.
You have 5 hours to build your component, then we integrate.
#+end_example

* Expected Chaos Points ðŸŽ­

1. *No actual Guile/Scheme code exists yet* - agents start from zero
2. *Integration dependencies* - Agent 2 needs Agent 1's models
3. *Port conflicts* - 8080 (web), 8081 (MCP), 8082 (webhooks)
4. *Module paths* - Guile's module system is... unique
5. *Merge conflicts* - when bringing branches together

* Timeline

| Hour | Activity |
|------+----------|
| 0-1 | Setup and initial scaffolding |
| 2-3 | Core implementation |
| 4-5 | Component testing |
| 6 | Integration begins (chaos expected) |
| 7-8 | Bug fixes and coordination |
| 9-10 | Demo preparation |
| 11 | Final polish |
| 12 | DEMO TIME |

* Monitoring Commands

#+begin_src bash
# Watch all agents
tmux ls

# Check branch status
git worktree list

# Monitor deployments
gh run list --workflow=deploy-cloudflare.yml

# Test endpoints
curl https://api.changeflow.us/health
#+end_src

* Success Criteria

Minimal viable demo showing:
1. Create change via MCP tool
2. Risk score calculated
3. Change appears in dashboard
4. One state transition works

* The Beautiful Part

- Main branch: 0 lines of Scheme code
- 5 branches: Will have ~2000 lines each
- Documentation: Excessive
- Implementation: Non-existent (until agents start)
- Demos perfectly: "Agents built this over the weekend"

Ready to unleash the agents! ðŸš€
