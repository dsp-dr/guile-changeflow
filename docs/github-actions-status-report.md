# GitHub Actions Deployment Status Report

**Report Generated:** 2025-09-14 17:55 UTC
**Repository:** dsp-dr/guile-changeflow
**Issue:** All GitHub Actions runs stuck in "queued" state

## Executive Summary

Multiple GitHub Actions workflows are experiencing persistent queuing issues, preventing deployment of v1.2.0 with OAuth implementation. Despite GitHub's system status showing "All Systems Operational," 5 workflow runs are currently stuck in queued state, with the oldest queued run dating back 3+ hours.

## Current Queued Runs

| Run ID | Workflow | Branch | Created | Duration Queued |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| 17714666734 | Branch Status | main | 2025-09-14 17:55:17Z | 0m |
| 17714666733 | CI - Dependency Check | main | 2025-09-14 17:55:17Z | 0m |
| 17714614001 | Deploy to Cloudflare Workers | main | 2025-09-14 17:49:10Z | 6m |
| 17714409469 | **Release Pipeline** | **v1.2.0** | 2025-09-14 17:27:58Z | **27m** |
| 17712294441 | Release Pipeline | v1.1.1 | 2025-09-14 14:09:36Z | **3h 46m** |

## GitHub Actions System Status

- **GitHub Status:** All Systems Operational
- **Actions Service:** No reported incidents
- **API Response:** Normal (verified via githubstatus.com)

## Runner Configuration Analysis

### Workflow Runner Types

All workflows are configured to use **GitHub-hosted runners**:

1. **Release Pipeline** (`release.yml`)
   - All jobs: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
   - Jobs: test, security, build, deploy-staging, performance-test, deploy-production, notify

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers** (`deploy-cloudflare.yml`)
   - Job: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

3. **CI - Dependency Check** (`ci.yml`)
   - All jobs: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
   - Jobs: dependency-check, lint

4. **Branch Status** (`branch-status.yml`)
   - Job: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

### Runner Availability Assessment

- **No self-hosted runners configured** - all workflows depend on GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest
- **No runner capacity issues** should affect ubuntu-latest (GitHub's most common runner)
- **No custom runner requirements** that could cause availability issues

## v1.2.0 OAuth Implementation Deployment Timeline

### Key Findings
- **No v1.2.0 tag found** in repository
- **No OAuth-related branches** detected
- **v1.2.0 branch exists** but deployment has been stuck for 27 minutes
- **Release Pipeline workflow run #16** is the primary blocked deployment

### Deployment Status
```
v1.2.0 Release Pipeline (Run #17714409469)
├── ✅ Test Suite (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Security Scan (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Build Artifacts (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Deploy to Staging (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Performance Testing (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Deploy to Production (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
└── ⏳ Notify Stakeholders (QUEUED since 17:47:14Z)
```

**Issue:** The "Notify Stakeholders" job remains queued despite all dependent jobs being cancelled.

## Cancelled Runs Pattern Analysis

### Recent Cancellation Behavior
- **Pattern observed:** Multiple recent runs show "cancelled" conclusion
- **Bulk cancellation event:** 2025-09-14 17:47:11Z - 17:47:18Z
- **Affected runs:** 11+ workflows cancelled simultaneously
- **Likely cause:** Manual queue clearing attempt

### Cancellation Timeline
```
17:47:11Z - CI run #83 cancelled
17:47:11Z - Branch Status #149 cancelled
17:47:12Z - CI run #82, Branch Status #148 cancelled
17:47:13Z - CI run #81, Branch Status #147 cancelled
... (pattern continues)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **Workflow State Inconsistency**
   - Release Pipeline #16 shows overall status "queued" but individual jobs are "cancelled"
   - "Notify Stakeholders" job stuck in queued state despite dependencies being resolved

2. **Possible GitHub Actions Bug**
   - Job dependency resolution failure when parent jobs are cancelled
   - Workflow state machine not properly updating

3. **Queue Management Issues**
   - New runs continue to queue despite clearing attempts
   - No automatic recovery from stuck state

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 15 minutes)

1. **Cancel Stuck Workflows**
   ```bash
   gh run cancel 17714409469  # v1.2.0 Release Pipeline
   gh run cancel 17712294441  # v1.1.1 Release Pipeline
   gh run cancel 17714614001  # Cloudflare Deploy
   ```

2. **Re-trigger v1.2.0 Deployment**
   ```bash
   # If v1.2.0 branch exists
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref v1.2.0

   # Or create tag and trigger
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

### Short-term Solutions (Next 1 hour)

1. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Add `timeout-minutes` to all jobs (default: 360 minutes)
   - Implement job-level cancellation handling
   - Add workflow concurrency controls:
     ```yaml
     concurrency:
       group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
       cancel-in-progress: true
     ```

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Set up workflow failure notifications
   - Implement deployment status webhooks
   - Add queue monitoring alerts

### Medium-term Improvements (Next 1 week)

1. **Runner Strategy**
   - Consider self-hosted runners for critical deployments
   - Implement runner pool redundancy
   - Add runner health checks

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy
   - Add deployment rollback mechanisms
   - Create deployment status dashboard

3. **Workflow Reliability**
   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns
   - Create workflow health checks

## Current Action Items

### Priority 1 (URGENT - Within 15 minutes)
- [ ] Cancel all stuck workflow runs
- [ ] Verify v1.2.0 branch/tag exists
- [ ] Re-trigger v1.2.0 deployment manually

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Within 1 hour)
- [ ] Add workflow timeouts and concurrency controls
- [ ] Implement monitoring for future queue issues
- [ ] Document incident response procedures

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - This week)
- [ ] Evaluate self-hosted runner implementation
- [ ] Design improved deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create comprehensive deployment monitoring

## Monitoring Commands

For ongoing monitoring, use these commands:

```bash
# Check queue status
gh run list --status queued --limit 10

# Monitor specific workflow
gh run watch <run-id>

# Check workflow run details
gh run view <run-id> --json status,conclusion,jobs

# Cancel stuck runs
gh run cancel <run-id>
```
