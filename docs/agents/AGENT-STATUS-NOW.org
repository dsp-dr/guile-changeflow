#+TITLE: Agent Status - Session Started
#+DATE: 2025-09-13 21:40 UTC
#+STARTUP: overview

* Current Status

All 5 agents have been deployed and are actively working on their tasks.

** Agent Sessions
| Agent | Session | Worktree | Status |
|-------+---------+----------+--------|
| Core Models | gcf-a1 | gcf-core-models | ‚úÖ Reading instructions, started implementation |
| MCP Server | gcf-a2 | gcf-mcp-server | ‚úÖ Reading instructions, checking directory |
| Risk Engine | gcf-a3 | gcf-risk-engine | ‚úÖ Reading instructions |
| Web Interface | gcf-a4 | gcf-web-interface | ‚úÖ Reading instructions |
| Integrations | gcf-a5 | gcf-integrations | ‚úÖ Reading instructions |

** Timeline
- 21:22 - Tmux sessions created
- 21:24 - Claude started in all sessions
- 21:25 - Initial instructions provided
- 21:40 - All agents reading instructions and beginning work

** Next Steps
1. User getting food - agents will work autonomously
2. Check back in 4 hours to review progress
3. Let agents run overnight for completion

** Monitoring Commands
#+begin_src bash
# Quick status of all agents
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "=== Agent $i ==="
  tmux capture-pane -t gcf-a$i -p | grep -E "‚óè|‚úì|‚úó" | tail -5
done

# Attach to specific agent
tmux attach -t gcf-a1  # Core Models
tmux attach -t gcf-a2  # MCP Server
tmux attach -t gcf-a3  # Risk Engine
tmux attach -t gcf-a4  # Web Interface
tmux attach -t gcf-a5  # Integrations

# Check if agents are active
tmux ls | grep gcf-
#+end_src

* Notes

The agents are all working from the same comprehensive documentation but have no implementation to start with. This is the real test - can they build a working system from specifications alone?

Each agent has:
- Their specific instruction file in instructions/<role>.org
- Access to all project documentation
- Their own git worktree/branch
- 5 hours for initial implementation
- Integration phase after individual work

Enjoy your food! The agents are hard at work. ü§ñ
