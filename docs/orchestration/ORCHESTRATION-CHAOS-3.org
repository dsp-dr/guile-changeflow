#+TITLE: Orchestration Chaos 3: The Great Merge
#+DATE: 2025-09-13 21:50

* THE ULTIMATE CHAOS: Merging 6 Isolated Branches

** The Setup
- 5 agent branches (feat/core-models, feat/mcp-server, feat/risk-engine, feat/web-interface, feat/integrations)
- 1 integration branch (with meta work)
- All merging into main
- Agents have been working in COMPLETE ISOLATION
- No agent knows what the others built
- This is going to be EPIC

** The Merge Strategy
1. main ← integration (meta work)
2. main ← feat/core-models (Agent 1)
3. main ← feat/mcp-server (Agent 2)
4. main ← feat/risk-engine (Agent 3)
5. main ← feat/web-interface (Agent 4)
6. main ← feat/integrations (Agent 5)

** Expected Conflicts
- Multiple schema.sql files?
- Different worker.js implementations?
- Overlapping test files?
- Duplicate battle scenarios?
- Who even knows what else?

** The Plan
1. Document everything
2. Merge fearlessly
3. Resolve conflicts aggressively
4. Tell agents to retest EVERYTHING
5. Pray to the demo gods

** Time Check
- Current: 21:50 PST
- Demo: 07:00 PST
- Time remaining: 9.2 hours
- Stress level: MAXIMUM

* Beginning the Chaos

Starting merge sequence...

** PLOT TWIST: The Branches Are Empty!

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git merge feat/core-models --no-edit  # Already up to date.
git merge feat/mcp-server --no-edit   # Already up to date.
git merge feat/risk-engine --no-edit  # Already up to date.
git merge feat/web-interface --no-edit # Already up to date.
git merge feat/integrations --no-edit  # Already up to date.
#+END_SRC

*** The Reality Check
- Agents have been "working" for hours
- But they haven't committed anything to their branches!
- All the production code was created by the Task agent
- Individual agents are still processing

*** What Actually Exists
- Integration branch: Has all the meta work and Task agent's production code
- Agent branches: Empty (no commits beyond initial branch creation)
- Main branch: Now has everything from integration

*** The Comedy Continues
- Expected: Massive merge conflicts from 5 agents
- Reality: Nothing to merge because agents haven't committed
- The Task agent built the entire system while individual agents contemplated

** New Plan: Force Agents to Work on Main

Since there's nothing to merge, we'll:
1. Tell all agents to checkout main
2. Have them test the integrated system
3. Make them add any missing pieces
