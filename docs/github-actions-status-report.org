*Report Generated:* 2025-09-14 17:55 UTC *Repository:*
dsp-dr/guile-changeflow *Issue:* All GitHub Actions runs stuck in
"queued" state

** Executive Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: executive-summary
:END:
Multiple GitHub Actions workflows are experiencing persistent queuing
issues, preventing deployment of v1.2.0 with OAuth implementation.
Despite GitHub's system status showing "All Systems Operational," 5
workflow runs are currently stuck in queued state, with the oldest
queued run dating back 3+ hours.

** GitHub Actions System Status

- *Actions Service:* No reported incidents
- *API Response:* Normal (verified via githubstatus.com)

** Runner Configuration Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: runner-configuration-analysis
:END:
*** Workflow Runner Types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: workflow-runner-types
:END:
All workflows are configured to use *GitHub-hosted runners*:

1. *Release Pipeline* (=release.yml=)
   - All jobs: =runs-on: ubuntu-latest=
   - Jobs: test, security, build, deploy-staging, performance-test,
     deploy-production, notify
2. *Deploy to Cloudflare Workers* (=deploy-cloudflare.yml=)
   - Job: =runs-on: ubuntu-latest=
3. *CI - Dependency Check* (=ci.yml=)
   - All jobs: =runs-on: ubuntu-latest=
   - Jobs: dependency-check, lint
4. *Branch Status* (=branch-status.yml=)
   - Job: =runs-on: ubuntu-latest=

*** Runner Availability Assessment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: runner-availability-assessment
:END:
- *No self-hosted runners configured* - all workflows depend on
  GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest
- *No runner capacity issues* should affect ubuntu-latest (GitHub's most
  common runner)
- *No custom runner requirements* that could cause availability issues

** v1.2.0 OAuth Implementation Deployment Timeline
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: v1.2.0-oauth-implementation-deployment-timeline
:END:
*** Key Findings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-findings
:END:
- *No v1.2.0 tag found* in repository
- *No OAuth-related branches* detected
- *v1.2.0 branch exists* but deployment has been stuck for 27 minutes
- *Release Pipeline workflow run #16* is the primary blocked deployment

*** Deployment Status
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deployment-status

#+begin_example
v1.2.0 Release Pipeline (Run #17714409469)
├── ✅ Test Suite (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Security Scan (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Build Artifacts (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Deploy to Staging (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Performance Testing (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
├── ✅ Deploy to Production (cancelled at 17:47:14Z)
└── ⏳ Notify Stakeholders (QUEUED since 17:47:14Z)
#+end_example

*Issue:* The "Notify Stakeholders" job remains queued despite all
dependent jobs being cancelled.

** Cancelled Runs Pattern Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cancelled-runs-pattern-analysis
:END:
*** Recent Cancellation Behavior
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recent-cancellation-behavior
:END:
- *Pattern observed:* Multiple recent runs show "cancelled" conclusion
- *Bulk cancellation event:* 2025-09-14 17:47:11Z - 17:47:18Z
- *Affected runs:* 11+ workflows cancelled simultaneously
- *Likely cause:* Manual queue clearing attempt

*** Cancellation Timeline
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cancellation-timeline
:END:
#+begin_example
17:47:11Z - CI run #83 cancelled
17:47:11Z - Branch Status #149 cancelled
17:47:12Z - CI run #82, Branch Status #148 cancelled
17:47:13Z - CI run #81, Branch Status #147 cancelled
... (pattern continues)

** Root Cause Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: root-cause-analysis
:END:
*** Primary Issues Identified
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: primary-issues-identified
:END:
1. *Workflow State Inconsistency*
   - Release Pipeline #16 shows overall status "queued" but individual
     jobs are "cancelled"
   - "Notify Stakeholders" job stuck in queued state despite
     dependencies being resolved
2. *Possible GitHub Actions Bug*
   - Job dependency resolution failure when parent jobs are cancelled
   - Workflow state machine not properly updating
3. *Queue Management Issues*
   - New runs continue to queue despite clearing attempts
   - No automatic recovery from stuck state
