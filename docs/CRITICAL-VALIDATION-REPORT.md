- **Repository**: Clean working tree
- **Latest Commit**: e9fe59f (deployment fix)

### OAuth Functionality
- **OAuth Redirect**: Working (302) ✅
- **Discovery Endpoint**: Working (200) ✅
- **Authentication Flow**: Operational ✅

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Status | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Production Stability | Operational | LOW |
| Deployment Pipeline | Fixed & Working | LOW |
| OAuth Implementation | Functional | MEDIUM* |
| Performance | Optimal | LOW |
| Repository State | Clean | LOW |

*OAuth has known security issues documented for validation phase only

## Critical Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Deployment pipeline now auto-deploys main to production
2. ✅ CI queue cleared and restarted
3. ✅ Version 1.4.2 successfully deployed
4. ✅ All endpoints verified operational

## Conclusion

**PRODUCTION IS FULLY OPERATIONAL AND STABLE**

All critical systems have been validated and are functioning correctly. The deployment pipeline has been fixed to ensure main branch pushes automatically deploy to production. Version 1.4.2 is live with all endpoints responding within expected parameters.

### Recommendations
- Continue monitoring CI/CD pipeline
- OAuth security hardening after validation phase
- Regular endpoint health checks via automation
