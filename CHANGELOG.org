*** The Beautiful But Broken Release ðŸŽ­

**** Added
- Workshop 02: ITIL Change Management Deep Dive
  - 3-hour comprehensive workshop on modern change management
  - Functional Scheme simulator demonstrating 68% automation
  - Based on Atlassian's ITSM best practices
- Git notes with ITIL compliance assessments
  - Recursive self-assessment using our own risk calculator
  - Beautiful irony of assessing our assessment system
- Missing (web server http) import for Guile MCP server
  - Now theoretically compilable (still doesn't run)

**** Changed
- Converted CHANGE-REQUEST-MCP-DEPLOYMENT.md to proper org-mode format
- Moved change request to =docs/change-requests/= with ITIL structure
- Replaced CHANGELOG.md with CHANGELOG.org (because Markdown is inferior)

**** Fixed
- Guile MCP server compilation errors (partially)
- Workshop simulator =hash-count= function usage

**** Beautiful Ironies
- Using broken Scheme to assess broken Scheme
- Following ITIL to bypass ITIL
- Achieving 68% automation in simulator while having 0% working code
- Functional programming that's barely functional

*** Technical Details
- 22 Guile modules (that don't compile)
- Custom JSON parser for Guile 3 (untested)
- MCP protocol implementation (beautiful but broken)
- Risk assessment: 15/100 (auto-approved)

* Meta-Commentary

This changelog itself follows our ITIL change management process:
- Change Type: Standard (documentation update)
- Risk Score: 5/100 (minimal risk)
- Approval: Auto-approved
- Rollback Plan: =git revert= if org-mode offends anyone

The beautiful recursion continues: documenting changes to our change management 
system in a changelog that itself represents a managed change. ðŸŽ­

* Release Philosophy

** Versioning Strategy
- Major: Breaking changes or paradigm shifts
- Minor: New features or significant improvements  
- Patch: Bug fixes and small improvements
- Tags: Philosophical releases (e.g., -scheme-beauty)

** Release Names
We use descriptive tags that capture the essence of each release:
- =v1.0.0= - The working JavaScript version
- =v1.1.0-scheme-beauty= - The beautiful but broken Scheme version
- Future: =v2.0.0-actually-works= - When Scheme finally compiles
