#+TITLE: Guile ChangeFlow Experiments

* Experiments Directory

This directory contains isolated experiments for testing and validating various aspects of the Guile ChangeFlow system. Each experiment is self-contained in its own subdirectory.

** Structure

Each experiment follows this naming convention:
- =XXX-name= where XXX is a three-digit number for ordering

Each experiment directory contains:
- =README.org= - Documentation for the experiment
- =Makefile= - Build and test commands for the experiment
- NO other code or artifacts (those belong in worktrees/branches)

** Purpose

Experiments serve to:
1. Validate tool availability and versions
2. Test architectural decisions
3. Prototype features in isolation
4. Document findings for future reference
5. Provide templates for agent/worktree tasks

** Current Experiments

| Experiment | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| [[file:000-core-tools/README.org][000-core-tools]] | Validate core toolchain | Active |

** Guidelines

1. Each experiment must be completely self-contained
2. Document all findings in the README.org
3. Use Makefile targets for all operations
4. No code artifacts should be committed
5. Results should inform main development

** Creating New Experiments

To create a new experiment:

#+begin_src bash
# Get next number
NUM=$(printf "%03d" $(($(ls -d [0-9][0-9][0-9]-* 2>/dev/null | wc -l) + 1)))
NAME="your-experiment-name"

# Create directory
mkdir $NUM-$NAME

# Create README
cat > $NUM-$NAME/README.org << EOF
#+TITLE: Experiment: $NAME
#+DATE: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

* Objective

[State the goal of this experiment]

* Hypothesis

[What we expect to find/prove]

* Method

[How we will test]

* Results

[Document findings]

* Conclusions

[What we learned]
EOF

# Create Makefile
cat > $NUM-$NAME/Makefile << 'EOF'
.PHONY: all test clean help

help:
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo "  test  - Run experiment tests"
	@echo "  clean - Clean up artifacts"

test:
	@echo "Running experiment..."

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning up..."
EOF
#+end_src

** Worktree Integration

Experiments can spawn worktrees for actual implementation:

#+begin_src bash
# From an experiment directory
git worktree add ../../guile-changeflow-exp-$NAME -b exp/$NAME
#+end_src

This keeps experiments clean while allowing full development in worktrees.
